Modern Merchant's Design Themes

Modern Merchant's page designs can be quickly swapped for new designs. That
is, you can plug in a new theme, and the web site's design will change to the
design defined by the new theme.

If you want to change the default theme, copy the entire 'default/' folder,
and give the new folder a new name. The new folder should live in the
'themes/' folder. Next, go to the Management Interface, go to the
Configuration menu, and select 'Themes'. Find your new theme in the list of
themes shown. Click the 'select' link for your theme. Now, you can modify your theme's files at will.

See the http://www.modernmerchant.org/ for more complete information about
themes.
