Modern Merchant Coding Style

There are many, many examples of Modern Merchant code that doesn't follow these
rules. If convenient, please make the appropriate corrections to existing code.

- All text files: Configure your editor to save files with *nix line endings:
  "\n"

- Non-template, non-indented PHP code should start on column zero.

  // Example:
  <?php
  echo "hello\n";

  // Bad:
  <?php
      echo "hello\n";

- Even though the Modern Merchant code base is littered throughout with tab
  characters for indenting, please use four (4) spaces for indenting new code
  or altered code. Eventually the entire code base will be indented this way.

- Non-template files should omit the end-of-tag token, '?>'

- Syntax for PHP blocks (if, while, for, foreach): KEYWORD, SPACE, LEFT-PAREN,
  EXPRESSION, RIGHT-PAREN, SPACE, LEFT-CURLY-BRACKET, EOL

  // Examples:
  if ($name == 'PHP') {
  }
  while (strlen($str) > 0) {
  }
  foreach ($ar as $k=>$v) {
  }

- If on opening curly bracket starts on the second line, it should be on the
  same column as the beginning of the statement.

  // Example:
  function myfunc()
  {
      echo "hello\n";
  }

- No more than one consecutive blank line

- Don't use ereg functions. Use preg instead.
