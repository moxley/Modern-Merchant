Architecture:
( ) Public and Private files area
( ) Plugin architecture
( ) MVC restructuring
	( ) Controllers become ActionSuites: XXXActions, except for

	    configuration instead.
	( ) Move all SQL statements to DAO objects
( ) More flexible and powerful relationship between products and images and between
    categories and images
( ) Disk-base caching of configuration, settings, pages, and result sets

( ) In the configuration, there are filepaths and url paths. There should be a
    function that converts a filepath into a url path.
( ) Data stored in sessions: Migrate from heirarchical data structures to a simple
    fetch-by-single-key strategy
( ) Internationalization
