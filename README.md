# Modern Merchant

Modern Merchant is a simple e-commerce platform written in PHP. It features a catalog manager and shopping cart
that works with PayPal and Authorize.net. Unlike other PHP shopping carts, Modern Merchant features a true plugin
system that doesn't break your upgrade path when you install a third-party feature.
