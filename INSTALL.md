Installation Instructions
=========================

1. Create or obtain a MySQL database and associated MySQL user account. You will 
   need the database name, username, password, and possibly the host name for the database.
2. Download Modern Merchant.
3. Unzip (and FTP, if necessary) the package to the Document Root of your web site. 
4. Rename the uploaded folder as "mm".
5. With your browser, simply visit the site at the /mm/install.php path,
   and the Modern Merchant web installer will help you from there. For example,
   http://example.com/mm/install.php. If you used FTP to upload
   the files, keep your FTP program open for the first step of the web installer.
   Likewise for command line users.
