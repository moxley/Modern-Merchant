** Quick Installation - UNIX/Linux **
1. Create or obtain a MySQL database and associated MySQL user account. You will 
   need the database name, username, password, and possibly the host name for the database.
2. Download Modern Merchant
3. Unzip (and FTP, if necessary) the package to the Document Root of your web site. 
   Warning: This will overwrite index.php of your web site, if you already have index.php. 
   Also, instead of a single folder, the Modern Merchant package consists of several 
   files and folders at its root. However, most of the files and folders start with "mm". This makes it easy to clean up if you decide to remove Modern Merchant. Backup your site if you have any doubts about this step.
4. With your browser, simply visit the site, and the Modern Merchant installer will 
   help you from there. If you used FTP to upload the files, you may want to keep your 
   FTP program open for the first step of the installation. Likewise for command line 
   users.
